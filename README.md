# VHDL Counter with Potential Overflow and Clocking Issues

This repository demonstrates a simple VHDL counter and highlights potential issues related to overflow and clock synchronization.

## Bug Description

The provided VHDL code implements a 4-bit counter.  However, it lacks robust handling of potential issues:

1. **Overflow:** The code correctly resets the counter when it reaches 15.  But it could be improved by adding more robust checks or using a modulo operation.
2. **Clocking Issues:**  Asynchronous reset and clock glitches can lead to unexpected behavior. The current implementation assumes a clean, glitch-free clock and reset signals.
3. **Signal Assignments:** The direct assignment (`count <= internal_count;`) might be affected by the timing and potential delays in the circuit.

The solution file offers an improved version that addresses these issues using better clock handling and signal assignment techniques. 

## Solution

The solution addresses the potential problems, mainly by adding more sophisticated handling of the clock and reset signals, and by using a more robust way of handling the counter's value. This ensures that the counter works correctly even in the presence of clock noise or glitches.
